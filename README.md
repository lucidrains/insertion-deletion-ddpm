## Insertion Deletion Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (wip)

Implementation of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07675">Insertion Deletion Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</a>. This scheme basically allows for DDPM to work beyond just in-place corruption along the sequence. I think it holds promise for protein design and we could use a good open sourced implementation.
